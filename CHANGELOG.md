## [1.1.4] - 2026-02-12

### What's New in v1.1.4
- **Custom LLM Providers:** Connect to any OpenAI-compatible API (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, commercial endpoints) simply by pasting a cURL command.
- **Smart Local AI:** Enhanced Ollama integration that automatically detects and lists your available local models—no configuration required.
- **Refined Human Persona:** Major updates to system prompts (`prompts.ts`) to ensure responses are concise, conversational, and indistinguishable from a real candidate.
- **Anti-Chatbot Logic:** Specific negative constraints to prevent "AI-like" lectures, distinct "robot" preambles, and over-explanation.
- **Global Spotlight Search:** Access AI chat instantly with `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`.
- **Masquerading (Undetectable Mode):** Stealth capability to disguise the app as common utility processes (Terminal, Activity Monitor) for discreet usage.
